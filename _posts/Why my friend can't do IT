<h1>Why my friend can't do IT</h1>
<p>My friend can't do IT because he is always relying on me to do it for him. Also I am myself am not good at IT so when he tries/copies it is utterly useless. I mean he hasn't even posted anything (LITERALLY NOTHING!) So that is why my friend can not do IT well at all  </p>

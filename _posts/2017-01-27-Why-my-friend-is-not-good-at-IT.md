My friend can't do IT because he is always relying on me to do it for him. Also I am myself am not good at IT so when he tries/copies it is utterly useless. I mean he hasn't even posted anything (LITERALLY NOTHING!) So that is why my friend can not do IT well at all.

He is absolutely rubbish, even though he tries his hardest to do well in IT. As I am typing this I have actually just messed something up on his github accidentally. So maybe I am the bad one at the thing that many people have been known to call IT, not my friend. 

Dear my friend I am truly sorry for what I have done
